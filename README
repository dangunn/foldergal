This is really a combination of scripts I found elsewhere
I wrote make_gallery.sh to sew them together

the gallery template was from creative commons,
the python script to resize images was from pythonware
It requires the PIL

the output image size is MAX_HEIGHT and MAX_WIDTH variables in the resize_image.py  you can adjust those to suit your needs

you need a originals folder containing folders that contain jpg images, it uses this as reference.
e.g
originals/Animals/Alpacas.jpg
originals/Animals/Heads in the Clouds .jpg
originals/Animals/Red River Hog.jpg
originals/Apes/Aux Pax Aut Bellum.jpg
originals/Apes/Concert.jpg
originals/Music/Death Letter.jpg
originals/Music/Strictly Blue Grass.JPG
originals/Music/Waits.JPG
originals/Music/Young.jpg

will generate:

staging/Animals.html
staging/Apes.html
staging/Music.html
staging/img/Alpacas.jpg
staging/img/Aux Pax Aut Bellum.jpg
staging/img/Death Letter.jpg
staging/img/Heads in the Clouds .jpg
staging/img/Red River Hog.jpg
staging/img/Concert.jpg
staging/img/Young.jpg
staging/img/Waits.jpg

RUNNING:

type "make gallery"
this will generate files in staging.  Just open the htmls with your browser
