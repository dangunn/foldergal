This is really a combination of scripts I found elsewhere
I wrote make_gallery.sh to sew them together

the gallery template was from creative commons,
the python script to resize images was from pythonware
It requires the PIL

the output image size is MAX_HEIGHT and MAX_WIDTH variables in the resize_image.py  you can adjust those to suit your needs
